# Notes

To install and run the Docker container, first use wget to retreive the files: 

```wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/E-niek/Notes/refs/heads/dev/docker-compose.yml https://raw.githubusercontent.com/E-niek/Notes/refs/heads/dev/init.sql```

The, ajust the docker-compose.yml file to your needs, and after that, run ```docker compose up -d``` (or any command like that), and you can acces the app on the port you set!
